# Privacy Policy TrustID

The TrustID application never reads any private information stored on the mobile device. Moreover, it does not use any sensor data except from the camera.

Permission to access the user's camera is only needed to scan QR codes in the following scenario:

* During registration, the QR code contains a standard one-time-password URI. The TrustID app will securely store the sensitive information passed from the URI.

No other image seen by the camera is handled or stored by TrustID.
